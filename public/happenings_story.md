# From High Schools to International Expansion: The Happenings Journey

## Humble Beginnings in Danish High Schools

When Happenings first launched, our goal was straightforward: help Danish high school students organize their social lives and find events. We quickly gained traction, creating a digital ecosystem where students could connect, organize events, and participate in school activities.

Our growth in the high school segment was remarkable. From Frederikshavn in the north to SÃ¸nderborg in the south, and from Lemvig in the west to Copenhagen in the east, we covered the entire Danish map. Today, we're proud to be active in more than 25% of all Danish high schools, helping thousands of students every day.

But as our platform evolved, we realized we had built something with potential far beyond high school halls. We wanted to make a broader impact and reach more people. That's when an unexpected opportunity presented itself.

## A Turning Point: Juridisk Diskussionsklub at the University of Copenhagen

The turning point in our journey came when we met with Juridisk Diskussionsklub (JD), a student association at the University of Copenhagen. JD was looking for a solution to manage their members and events effectively. They were even considering building their own app from scratch.

This was our chance to take a leap forward. Instead of letting them start from zero, we proposed something different: "Why not let us do it for you?" We offered to adapt our existing platform to meet their specific needs.

What followed was a remarkable collaboration. We worked closely with JD, collecting their feedback, understanding their challenges, and adapting our platform based on their specific wishes and requirements. The process was eye-opening, showing us how university student associations face unique challenges that our platform was well-positioned to solve.

## Building a Platform Tailor-Made for Student Associations

Our work with Juridisk Diskussionsklub transformed Happenings. We shifted from a high-school focused platform to one specifically designed for university student associations. The result was a comprehensive solution that streamlined:

- **Ticket sales**: Simple event creation and ticket management with no fees or commissions
- **Membership management**: Digital membership cards and automated verification
- **Communication**: Direct channels between association leaders and members

Most importantly, we committed to keeping Happenings **completely free** for student clubs to use. No hidden fees, no transaction costs, no subscription plans. We believe that student associations should keep 100% of what they earn, allowing them to focus on creating meaningful experiences rather than worrying about platform costs.

## Expanding to Denmark's Largest Student Association

Our success with JD at the University of Copenhagen opened new doors. Soon, we began collaborating with Studenterlauget, Denmark's largest student association, based at Aarhus University. This partnership has been transformative for both parties.

Today, we're actively working with Studenterlauget to develop even more features specifically designed for student associations. Their scale and diversity of activities provide invaluable insights that help us improve the platform for all users.

## Going International: The Netherlands and Beyond

As word spread about our free, purpose-built platform for student associations, we began receiving interest from beyond Denmark's borders. Our first international expansion was to the Netherlands, where we now support student clubs in major university cities including:

- Leiden University
- Amsterdam University
- The Hague University of Applied Sciences

These partnerships taught us how to adapt our platform to different educational systems and student cultures while maintaining our core mission: empowering student associations with free, powerful digital tools.

## A New Frontier: Granada, Spain

Our most recent and exciting international partnership is with the Municipality of Granada in Southern Spain. This collaboration is particularly significant because Granada University hosts the highest number of international students through the Erasmus+ program in Europe.

Granada presents a unique situation where approximately 30% of the city's population (nearly one-third) are active students. This creates a dynamic but challenging environment for local businesses and the municipality.

We're working directly with the Municipality of Granada to improve day-to-day commerce in the city by connecting the student population with local businesses and cultural opportunities. This partnership represents a new dimension of our mission: not just supporting student associations, but helping entire student ecosystems thrive.

## The Future: Committed to Student Communities

As we look to the future, our commitment remains unwavering: to provide completely free, powerful tools for student associations worldwide. We believe that by removing financial barriers and technological hurdles, we empower students to create stronger communities and more meaningful experiences.

Our journey from Danish high schools to international university cities has taught us that while educational systems and student cultures may differ, the fundamental needs of student communities remain remarkably similar. Everyone wants to:

- Connect with like-minded peers
- Organize and discover events
- Manage memberships efficiently
- Communicate effectively

Happenings continues to evolve, driven by feedback from our partners and users. With each new feature and improvement, we stay true to our core mission: empowering students to create vibrant communities, free from technological or financial constraints.

Whether you're a small club at a local university or a massive student association with thousands of members, Happenings is built for you, completely free, and always will be.
